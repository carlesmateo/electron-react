# Electron React

This project was bootstrapped using the [Forge Electron (TypeScript + Webpack) template](https://www.electronforge.io/templates/typescript-+-webpack-template) and integrated with React and several other third-party modules.

Features:

- `/assets` directory for local assets
- `preload.ts` demonstrates three different IPC methods
- Style sheets using Sass `.scss`
